## Introduction
I am Jing Yang ( 荆洋 ) , majoring in Applied Mathematics. In 2020 Summer, I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) I am a member of [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), which is an elite mathematics program in SJTU for top 5% talented students.

My current research field :
* Machine Learning Algorithms
* Optimization
* Stochastic Partial Equations in Machine Learning
